# Cyber Skyline / National Cyber League (NCL) – CTF Experience

This repository documents my participation and performance in the **National Cyber League (NCL)**, a nationally recognized, scenario-driven cybersecurity competition hosted by **Cyber Skyline**.  
The NCL evaluates applied cybersecurity skills under timed, high-pressure conditions that closely resemble real-world **SOC**, **Incident Response**, and **Threat Analysis** workflows.

My participation includes both the **Fall 2025 Individual Game** and the **Fall 2025 Team Game**, where I served as **Team Captain**.

---

## Overview

The National Cyber League (NCL) is designed to measure hands-on technical competency across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, including:

- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Password Cracking
- Log Analysis
- Network Traffic Analysis
- Digital Forensics
- Cryptography
- Web Application Exploitation
- Scanning & Reconnaissance
- Enumeration & Exploitation

Challenges are mapped to **NIST NICE Workforce Framework** roles and align with performance-based objectives found in industry certifications (e.g., CompTIA, GIAC).

## Fall 2025 Individual Game – Performance Summary

**Rank:** 989 out of 7,865 competitors (Top 12.5%)  
**Total Score:** 1,535 / 3,000  
**Accuracy:** 57.6%  
**Completion:** 60.7%

The Individual Game evaluates **independent problem-solving ability**, without collaboration or external assistance. Performance reflects the ability to triage, analyze, and solve technical challenges under time constraints.

### Individual Strength Areas
- **Password Cracking:** 89.5% accuracy, 73.9% completion  
- **Cryptography:** 78.6% accuracy  
- **Log Analysis:** 64.7% accuracy, 78.6% completion  
- **OSINT:** 270 / 385 points  

This performance highlights strong analytical reasoning, pattern recognition, and applied tooling proficiency in solo environments.

## Fall 2025 Team Game – Performance Summary

**Team Rank:** 214 out of 4,215 teams (Top 5%)  
**Team Score:** 2,125 / 3,000  
**Accuracy:** 73.9%  
**Completion:** 72.9%  
**Role:** Team Captain

The Team Game simulates **collaborative security operations**, emphasizing coordination, task delegation, validation, and time-based decision-making.

### Leadership Responsibilities
As Team Captain, I was responsible for:
- Allocating tasks based on teammate strengths
- Prioritizing high-value challenges under time pressure
- Reviewing and validating answers prior to submission
- Coordinating cross-domain findings (OSINT → Web Exploitation → Log Analysis)
- Maintaining real-time documentation consistent with SOC workflows

### Team Strength Areas
- **Password Cracking:** 99th percentile
- **Web Application Exploitation:** 96th percentile
- **Forensics:** 95th percentile
- **OSINT:** 290 / 370 points

This performance demonstrates the ability to lead technical teams while maintaining accuracy and strategic focus in fast-moving environments.

- **Credential Access:** T1110 (Password Cracking)
- **Reconnaissance:** T1591, T1592, T1596 (OSINT)
- **Discovery:** T1087, T1083 (Log Analysis, Recon)
- **Defense Evasion:** T1070 (Log Manipulation)
- **Initial Access:** T1190 (Web Exploitation)
- **Command & Control:** T1071 (Network Traffic Analysis)
- **Exfiltration:** T1041

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Linux command-line workflows
- Hashcat (rule-based and hybrid attacks)
- OSINT investigation frameworks
- PCAP analysis and protocol inspection
- Log parsing and regex-based analysis
- Web enumeration and exploitation techniques
- Collaborative documentation and triage workflows

---

## Why This Matters

This experience validates the ability to operate effectively in environments that mirror:
- Security Operations Centers (SOC)
- Incident Response teams
- Threat Hunting and Threat Intelligence workflows
- Red/Blue team-style investigations

The combination of **top-percentile technical performance**, **team leadership**, and **cross-domain competency** reflects readiness for real-world cybersecurity roles where accuracy, speed, and judgment matter.
